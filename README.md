LuaResolver
======

A simple DNS resolver written entirely in Lua. It doesn't need bit operations
and is therefore compatible with Lua5.1, Lua5.2 and LuaJIT. The
only dependency is LuaSocket.

## Usage

The `Resolver:resolve()` method returns a sorted table with resource records or nil and
an error message.

```lua
local Resolver = require "dns.resolver"
local r = Resolver.new({"213.73.91.35"}, 2)
r:addServer("85.214.20.141")

local recs, errmsg = r:resolve("google.com", "*")
if not errmsg then
    for _, v in ipairs(recs) do
        print(v.name, v.type, v.class, v.content)
    end
end
```

The `Resolver:resolveRaw()` method returns more data about the DNS response and also
includes the raw data of the resource records. The returned table looks
something like this:

```lua
resultOfResolveRaw = {
    header = {
        id,         -- transaction id
        flags = {
            query = false,              -- if this is a query
            truncated = false,          -- message was truncated
            authoritativeAnswer = false,
            recursionDesired = true,
            recursionAvailable = true,
        },
        opCode,
        errCode, -- error code
        ttl,     -- time to live in seconds
        timeout, -- os.time() + ttl
    },
    questions = {},   -- queries that were sent
    answers = {
        [1] = {
            name,
            type,
            class,
            ttl,
            timeout,
            content,
            rawdata
        }
    },                -- resource records
    authorities = {}, -- resource records for the authoritative ns
    additionals = {}, -- additional resource records
}
```

## Demo

The demo.lua script simply prints the resource records to stdout.

```
lua demo.lua google.com "*"
google.com	A	IN	173.194.112.103
google.com	A	IN	173.194.112.100

## Documentation

new
-----
`syntax: r = Resolver.new(servers, timeout)`

Creates a new instance of `Resolver`.

* `servers`
	list of DNS servers
* `timeout`
	connection timeout

resolveRaw
-----
`syntax: resp, err = Resolver:resolveRaw(domainName, recordType)`

Starts a DNS query for the specified domain name and record
type. It iterates through the list of servers provided on instanciation or
through `addServer` and queries each one for the `domainName` and
`recordType` until one of them responds with a successful answer.
It returns a table with the parsed response or nil and an error message.


* `domainName`
	domain to be resolved
* `recordType`
	type of record to be queried (defaults to "A")

resolve
-----
`syntax: resp, err = Resolver:resolve(domainName, recordType)`

Works exactly the same as `resolveRaw`, but it flattens the
structure of the returned object and strips unnecessary data, like the
header. It returns a simple sorted list of resource records.

* `domainName`
	domain to be resolved
* `recordType`
	type of record to be queried (defaults to "A")


addServer
-----
`syntax: Resolver:addServer(server)`

Adds a DNS server to the list of servers

* `server`
	DNS server

cleanup
-----
`syntax: Resolver:cleanup()`

Should be called periodically to cleanup the internal DNS cache

## TODO

* Support for TCP connections
* Support for more record types
